Coming into the studio prepared is the easiest way to get more hands-on time and less troubleshooting during your facial. Consider this the checklist I walk through with every new client before their first sculpting session.

## 48 hours before

- **Pause strong exfoliants.** This includes tretinoin, AHAs over 8%, and any at-home dermaplaning tools. We want your barrier calm so I can choose enzymes or microcurrent based on what your skin needs that day.
- **Hydrate on purpose.** Electrolytes or a pinch of mineral salt in your water helps the body carry nutrients (and lymph) efficiently. You will feel the difference once we start neck drainage.

## 24 hours before

- **Keep workouts light.** Intense training plus facial massage can leave you feeling overly sore. Gentle movement, stretching, or a walk is ideal.
- **Avoid new products.** If something causes a reaction the night before, I have to spend studio time calming it down instead of sculpting.
- **Confirm health status.** If you are feeling run down or actively fighting a cold, reschedule. Lymphatic work moves everything—including viruses.

## Morning of your appointment

- **Clean skin only.** A simple rinse or gentle cleanser is perfect. Skip makeup, heavy oils, and SPF if your appointment is before noon (you can reapply at the studio afterwards).
- **Eat a blood-sugar-friendly snack.** Protein plus fiber keeps you from feeling lightheaded during neck work.
- **Arrive a few minutes early.** It gives us space to review goals, fill out updates, and start on time.

## After your facial

- **Keep products minimal for 24 hours.** I’ll send you home with exactly what to apply that night and the next morning. Less is more while your skin equilibrates.
- **Stay elevated while you sleep.** A second pillow maintains drainage, especially if we focused on sinus work.
- **Book your next visit at checkout.** Consistency every 4–6 weeks keeps your progress compounding instead of starting from scratch each appointment.

These small steps add up to facials that feel luxurious and function like corrective treatments. Save this checklist, and send it to any friend joining you at the studio.
