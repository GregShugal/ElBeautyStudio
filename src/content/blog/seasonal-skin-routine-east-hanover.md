New Jersey weather keeps our skin guessing. Dry office heat, humid summers, and allergy season all require different tactics. Instead of buying a whole new regimen every time the temperature shifts, use a seasonal framework. Here is how I coach clients through the year.

## Spring reset (March–May)

- **Goal:** Calm lingering winter irritation and clear congestion from heavy moisturizers.
- **In-studio focus:** Gentle enzyme polish, lymphatic drainage around the jaw, and LED to keep allergy inflammation down.
- **At home:** Layer antioxidants in the morning (vitamin C plus niacinamide) and add a lightweight gel moisturizer at night. Keep a soothing mist at your desk for pollen-heavy days.

## Summer protection (June–August)

- **Goal:** Keep pores clear without stripping the barrier.
- **In-studio focus:** Deep cleansing custom facial with cool globes, plus high-frequency or blue LED for breakout-prone skin.
- **At home:** Swap to a mineral SPF you love reapplying. Use a clay mask once a week on the T-zone and follow with a hydrating serum so you do not overcompensate with oil.

## Fall rebuilding (September–November)

- **Goal:** Repair sun stress and prep for drier air.
- **In-studio focus:** Brightening enzymes, dermaplaning add-ons, and targeted peels spaced four weeks apart.
- **At home:** Introduce a gentle retinoid 2–3 nights per week, then chase it with a ceramide-rich moisturizer. This is also the season to replace your humidifier filters.

## Winter nourishment (December–February)

- **Goal:** Protect the barrier and keep circulation moving when we spend more time indoors.
- **In-studio focus:** Sculpting face massage, warm oil infusions, and red LED to boost microcirculation.
- **At home:** Layer hydration (essence + serum + cream) and seal with a few drops of squalane on the coldest nights. Keep a silk pillowcase so skin is not wicking moisture away while you sleep.

### How to plan your bookings

- Every 4 weeks if you are working on corrective goals (acne, pigmentation, muscle tension)
- Every 6 weeks for maintenance once skin is stable
- Add a bonus session before major events or travel so you hit the reset button before stress hits

When you treat skincare like a seasonal ritual instead of a last-minute fix, you stay ahead of issues and spend less overall. Screenshot this roadmap, and bring it to your next appointment so we can customize the details for your skin.
